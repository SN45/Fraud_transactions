Project Description
This project implements a robust Real-Time Fraud Detection Pipeline designed to identify and analyze fraudulent transactions efficiently. Leveraging a powerful tech stack that includes Apache Kafka, AWS S3, AWS Glue, AWS Athena, and Tableau, the pipeline ingests, processes, and visualizes credit card transaction data in real time, enabling proactive fraud detection and risk management.

Key Features
Data Ingestion: Utilizes Apache Kafka to stream transaction data in real time, handling thousands of transactions per second.
Data Storage: Stores incoming transaction data in Amazon S3, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for managing large datasets.
ETL Automation: Employs AWS Glue to automate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, ensuring data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis without the need for complex infrastructure management.
Data Analysis: Utilizes AWS Athena to query data stored in S3 using standard SQL, allowing for rapid analysis and insight generation.
Data Visualization: Creates interactive dashboards using Tableau to visualize key metrics, fraud trends, and insights, facilitating informed decision-making for stakeholders.
Technologies Used
Apache Kafka: Real-time data streaming and processing.
AWS S3: Scalable storage solution for transaction data.
AWS Glue: ETL automation for data preparation and cleaning.
AWS Athena: Serverless querying of data using SQL.
Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the capability to detect fraudulent transactions in real time, enabling financial institutions to mitigate risks and protect their customers effectively. By analyzing transaction patterns and trends, the pipeline provides actionable insights that improve fraud prevention strategies.
